The formula for an indefinite integral is generally expressed as:

\[
\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C
\]

where:
- \( f(x) \) is the integrand,
- \( F(x) \) is the antiderivative of \( f(x) \),
- \( C \) is the constant of integration. 

This represents the family of functions whose derivative is \( f(x) \).
